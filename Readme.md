# 2D_Ray casting
2d ray casting technique can be used in various application including obstacle detection in self driving cars via a neural net. This code is a simple simulation of a 2d Ray casting from a light source in a set of random boundaries within the domain.</br> 
The code uses the p5 library (https://pypi.org/project/p5/) to implement the graphical elements in the simulations. This eventually can be taken into 3d rendering.</br>
